After analyzing the pairplot we graphed of our data, we plan on preprocessing our data by dropping patient ID, Height, Weight, State, Smoker and Ecig status, and TetanusLast10Tdap. Patient ID is irrelevant from the rest of the data. For height and weight we can identify most of the extremes that are apparent using the BMI columns. State, Smoker/Ecig status, and TetanusLast10Tdap are labeled using varying string responses that would not make sense to keep and try to classify. We will able be processing the HadDiebetes column since it is in string format with 4 possible responses. Yes and No will be 1 and 0. Any rows with the options Yes, but only during pregnancy (female) and No, pre-diabetes or borderline diabetes will be removed from our dataset. This is because these are outlier cases in our dataset and we are plan to predict whether people strictly have or do not have diabetes. Since our dataset is already large and these responses are only a small fraction of the responses we will still have a sufficient dataset to predict diebetes.
